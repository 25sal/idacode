Why is it special to suddenly realize that those moais bodies were covered with soil...if you know about basalt rock decaying...turns brown on outside caused by sun and rain...then it falls off the block of volcanic rock as clay and rock chips...then these gradually washed downwards along the mountain slopes in the process mixing with other organic matter...eventually it reaches the hillside standing moais...over hundreds of years it  gradually builds up until it reaches around the statues necks as you see before  digging..are you so stupid as not to realize that without even digging....it seems that you've just got out of the class room and then outside of the high-rise jungles...you are talking about something that is not part of your lives and not your type of culture hence your excitement over a minor aspect of something of not much significance....the is not yours ...it.is.in the people of Te Pito O Te Henua....give them the respect owed to them and their ancestors,5,1,03/10/2023 09:45:37 AM,criticizes the fake news,0.597412645816803,non_irony,0.797552227973938,Likely critical or skeptical language.
