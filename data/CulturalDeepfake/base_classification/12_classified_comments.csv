"Okay just so I'm on the same page here....

South America was inhabited for about the last ~15k years, and North America for a bit longer, so that seems timeline accurate. 

Australia is at least 65,000 years so they're a little shy on that. 

China is around accurate as well, from what I can tell. 

The middle east was at least 150,000 years ago from what I can see. 

Europe 45,000 years ago or so. 

So the only egregious date I can see is that homo sapiens seem to have appeared roughly 300,000 years ago (not 130,000 years ago), right? 

Asking honestly on this one.

As opposed to the idea that African humans left Africa 130,000 years ago, spread across Asia, adapting and differentiating genetically along the way, until reaching the America's ~20,000 years ago and reaching the tip of South America by 13,000 years ago.",10,1,09/22/2024 06:15:44 PM,criticizes the fake news,0.5610641837120056

Like all these batshit theories it has its roots in stuff that is actually supportable and reasonable. Such as the ancient Egyptians probably DID look far more Nubian/ Sudanese than how we depict them today, and the British Empire did destroy the walls of Benin and claim the Benin bronzes / other great African works must have been the work of some early invader thus denying that black people were capable of such artistry.

Or after it. Or during it. (Choose whichever you like, it’s all bollocks). The original hyperdiffusionist notion was that Atlanteans were the ancient global super-race, which Hancock enthusiastically pushed but now distances himself from because he’s afraid people won’t take him seriously (lol).

"This image is a really big oversimplification of what happened. Currently also scientists are coming up with the hypothesis that we as Homo Sapiens didn't not come from a single point within Africa where the oldest Homo Sapiens is found, so around Ethopia. But we actually come from several points around Africa, multiple tribes that co-evolved and migrated. We also need to remember about the introgression with Denisovans and Neanderthals along the way. 

As for having a feather in your headpiece as ""proof"" is also really dumb. We find that a lot of civilizations throughout time have decorated themselves with bird feathers.
