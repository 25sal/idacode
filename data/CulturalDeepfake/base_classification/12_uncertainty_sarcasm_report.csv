"Okay just so I'm on the same page here....

South America was inhabited for about the last ~15k years, and North America for a bit longer, so that seems timeline accurate. 

Australia is at least 65,000 years so they're a little shy on that. 

China is around accurate as well, from what I can tell. 

The middle east was at least 150,000 years ago from what I can see. 

Europe 45,000 years ago or so. 

So the only egregious date I can see is that homo sapiens seem to have appeared roughly 300,000 years ago (not 130,000 years ago), right?

"Anthropologist here! The meme is pushing a pseudoscientific idea called hyperdiffusionism (the same “Ancient Origins” nonsense that Graham Hancock peddles). The idea is that there was an ancient, superior, technologically advanced progenitor race that spread the knowledge of pyramid building, civilization, and apparently wearing feathers (🤦🏼‍♂️) across the globe before the Last Glacial Maximum. Or after it. Or during it. (Choose whichever you like, it’s all bollocks). The original hyperdiffusionist notion was that Atlanteans were the ancient global super-race, which Hancock enthusiastically pushed but now distances himself from because he’s afraid people won’t take him seriously (lol). Other hyperdiffusionism greatest hits include Lemurians, Ancient Aliens, and Black Olmecs, among others; they all stem from the racist notion that Black and brown peoples couldn’t have figured out how to build pyramids, cut straight lines into stones, move heavy things, etc without outside help.",4,3,09/22/2024 07:43:41 PM,criticizes the fake news,0.5224075317382812,non_irony,0.6831767559051514,Sarcastic tone reinforced by emoji.
