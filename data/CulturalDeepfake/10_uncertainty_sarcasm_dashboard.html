If you look at the Central Asian territory that is not really hospitable for long term sedantery lifestyle, so most people in earlier history were pastoral\u002fnomadic. They worked as a connector between north and south, east and west, it made sense to develop a lingua franca which would then further develop into its own thing whenver intensive contact ceased. Since Europe and Asia are connected, there was just more space to overlap and exchange than to isolate. Imagine it like a spider web, if you like: the center forming a nexus, which we also see in economic history (silk road etc.) or epidemic history (plaguuuuue). The further you go along the net lines, the more lonely do the language groups become because it was harder to reach them (peninsulas, coasts, valleys between mountain ranges). But over time new economic networks formed closer by and then languages exchanged again for a bit, but according to the same principle. \n\nIt is not much different in Africa, actually. You have many many more individual and isolated languages but along the trade networks you find mixtures that over time partly isolated and then clustered again. \n\nThe Americas are different because were settled by humans later from a limited choice of languages.

      <td>--Marko Perkovicanarya can be a tricky form because it's not anārya which would be the an- negation of ārya, it's from possibly this short a an-arya. So what is short a arya? Well ari- in RV usually refers to the other clan or other clan Lord which threatens to subordinate our guy (svapati) in the coalition. The term aryah I think is a reanalysis of the genitive singular of ari "the Ari's (people) which is why in the later language arya- only refers to vaisyas not to rajanyas or brahmanas. But let me give you instead a very different etymon of anarya, it could be a-narya "unmanly" similarly an-rta- untrue has a double semantic of a-nRta "unmanly" that poets take full advantage of. Suffice to say it's a semantically complex affair. Sorry to wax prolix, I'm a Vedicist.</td>

They worked as a connector between north and south, east and west, it made sense to develop a lingua franca which would then further develop into its own thing whenver intensive contact ceased. Since Europe and Asia are connected, there was just more space to overlap and exchange than to isolate. Imagine it like a spider web, if you like: the center forming a nexus, which we also see in economic history (silk road etc.) or epidemic history (plaguuuuue). The further you go along the net lines, the more lonely do the language groups become because it was harder to reach them (peninsulas, coasts, valleys between mountain ranges). But over time new economic networks formed closer by and then languages exchanged again for a bit, but according to the same principle. \n\nIt is not much different in Africa, actually. You have many many more individual and isolated languages but along the trade networks you find mixtures that over time partly isolated and then clustered again. \n\nThe Americas are different because were settled by humans later from a limited choice of languages. Population density was comparatively low, people who traveled away were rarely encountered again and so languages isolated more but trade language clusters were more punctuated.</td>
