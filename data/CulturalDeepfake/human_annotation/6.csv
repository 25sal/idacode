"What if (Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, antithesis, scientists, psychology) Share same truth...?  Mankind is blind nowdays just like 7 brother argument for a elephant look.

We’ll begin to see 'others' not as somehow distant from us, but as people we are in touch with, people close to us; we will no longer feel indifferent to them.",18,0,"10/17/2015 12:39:17 PM","neutral",0.361986964941025,"neutral"
