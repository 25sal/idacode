The classification of languages has little to do with the fact that they've all been developing and evolving regardless of whether we randomly decided to call then something else at some point.

There are two countries currently named after them today. Ireland and Iran, both different ways of saying aryan land.

"-not really. If you look at the Central Asian territory that is not really hospitable for long term sedantery lifestyle, so most people in earlier history were pastoral/nomadic. They worked as a connector between north and south, east and west, it made sense to develop a lingua franca which would then further develop into its own thing whenver intensive contact ceased. Since Europe and Asia are connected, there was just more space to overlap and exchange than to isolate. Imagine it like a spider web, if you like: the center forming a nexus, which we also see in economic history (silk road etc.) or epidemic history (plaguuuuue). The further you go along the net lines, the more lonely do the language groups become because it was harder to reach them (peninsulas, coasts, valleys between mountain ranges). But over time new economic networks formed closer by and then languages exchanged again for a bit, but according to the same principle. 

It is not much different in Africa, actually. You have many many more individual and isolated languages but along the trade networks you find mixtures that over time partly isolated and then clustered again. 

The Americas are different because were settled by humans later from a limited choice of languages. Population density was comparatively low, people who traveled away were rarely encountered again and so languages isolated more but trade language clusters were more punctuated.",0,0,10/29/2025 06:12:12 PM,criticizes the fake news,3.622.243.404.388.420,

"too many people use that term wrongly, Aryan specifically means *Indo-Iranic* in their own early language *áryas to be specific —the word literally evolved into Iran and Alan,

the stupid proto-nazis stole it because of a then current misconception that आर्य (ā́rya, “noble; noble one”) was related to german Ehre-(""honor"") and Greek ᾰ̓́ρῐστος • (ắrĭstos) m  aristos-(""nobleman"" or adjective ""best"" superlative of ᾰ̓γᾰθός (ăgăthós))
and therefore that it was Proto-Indo-European, which it wasn't it was exclusively proto-Indo-Iranic, therefore the correct usage is only in that context and only goes to show who follows the scientific school and who the nazi propaganda school

In my opinion ārya is a derivative of ari- ""other"" cognate with Greek allos and the thing you do with the other is hospitality, and so ārya are those that participate in hospitality rites, and thus polite guest-host gift-exchange society.",2,0,10/30/2025 01:01:00 AM,believes the fake news,45.855.721.831.321.700,
"--CC Smith all right, yes I thought you meant the descendants Iran/Alan, I said about the others that it was a misconception concurrent with the rise of nazim,

by IndoEuropeanists of that era conflating ethnic consciousness and the meaning of the root, but even after that not a lot of concensus was reached so we can hypothesize all we want 😁

and yes Ehre is connected to the ""Indo-Slavic"" side's version *is- to seek, (my language has the archaic version still as a dialectal term 'iskati' - to search)

through 
ēre  <-    *aizō   <-  *h₂oys-éh₂,
from *h₂eys- (“to respect”)
interestingly into
*h₂i-sḱé-ti   ->  *iskāˀtei  ->  *jьskati

but I don't know about the very root of arya, it's quite contested and hard to pinpoint, to me ar- 'plough' sounds like some kind of semantic contamination with ar- 'to fit',  *h₂er-

as in arable, cultivated land or person, see Sanskrit anarya -uncivilized, non-aryan,
and also Sanskrit अवृक (avṛká, “safe”, literally “not wild”), वृकतात् (vṛká-tāt, “savagery”) from 'wolf'

which could be the ultimate source for both the Greek aristos and pIIr aryas, and could have been carried on by hospitality rites in which someone's best behavior, cultured manners would be praised,

which then under pressure from foreign groups became an inspiration for an endonym in the Aryan peoples, while just a description in the Greeks which later rose in prominence to mean the ruling class,

although there's another interesting example and that is Celtic *aryos (freeman, noble)
which could stem from the same tradition rather than be an invention of their own or it could be a later loan, although it's also connected to a Germanic : *arjaz (“distinguished, esteemed”)
which brings us back to points the nazis would love to hear 😂

The term aryah I think is a reanalysis of the genitive singular of ari ""the Ari's (people) which is why in the later language arya- only refers to vaisyas not to rajanyas or brahmanas. But let me give you instead a very different etymon of anarya, it could be a-narya ""unmanly"" similarly an-rta- untrue has a double semantic of a-nRta ""unmanly"" that poets take full advantage of.
